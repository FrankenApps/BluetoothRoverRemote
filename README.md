# BluetoothRoverRemote
This is an android app built to control a fishertechnik rover. I have built this app in order to control the tracked vehicle built with arduino and fishertechnik from my android phone via bluetooth.

Note: This was a project for school and I do not think it is useful for anybody without having the arduino code and the robot.
